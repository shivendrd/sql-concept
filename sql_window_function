select * from employee;

// max salary from the employee table

select max(salary) as max_salary from employee;

// min salary from the employee table

select min(salary) as min_salary from employee;


// max salary based on department 

select dept_name,max(salary) as max_salary 
from employee
group by dept_name;

// max salary based on department alongwith if you want to show other details best way is using window function or analytic function


// by writing window_function we need to use over() clause 

select e.*,
max(salary) over() as max_salary
from employee e;

explanation -- by using over() clause you can use as window function 

explanation of query - here max() will not use as a aggregate function over() clause is going to specify sql that you need to creat a window function 
by using this query  sql will create one window for all the records in this result set. and that one window its going to apply this query max(salary)

/// what will be the query for extract max salary corresponding to each department -- 
--- we can use a clause of partition by then mention column name 

select e.*,
max(salary) over(partition by dept_name) as max_salary
from employee e;

explanation of query - This query will do every distinct value present in dept_name column its going to create one window function and its going to apply max(salary) function to each of those window
by using this you can get max salary different from each of the department 

Note*--  same we can use other aggregate function like avg(), min(), max() etc.
